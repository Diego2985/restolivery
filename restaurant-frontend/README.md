# React Frontend Project

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the structure and usage of components.

## Project Structure

```
frontend
├── src
│   ├── App.js                # Main component of the application
│   ├── index.js              # Entry point of the React application
│   └── components
│       └── ExampleComponent.js # A functional component for displaying content
├── public
│   ├── index.html            # Main HTML file serving the React application
│   └── favicon.ico           # Favicon for the application
├── package.json              # Configuration file for npm
├── README.md                 # Documentation for the project
└── .gitignore                # Specifies files to be ignored by Git
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The main component is located in `src/App.js`, where you can modify the structure and add more components as needed.
- You can create additional components in the `src/components` directory and import them into `App.js`.
- The application is served from `public/index.html`, which contains the root div for mounting the React app.
